#Approach 1

    We are creating an empty list and using a loop that runs from 0 to n - 1. In each iteration, we take i, multiply it by 2, and add it to the list. After the loop finishes, we return the list and print the values with : in between

#Approach 2

    Instead of first making a list and then adding doubled numbers, we are using list comprehension to generate the list in a single step. Then, we loop through this list and print the values

#Approach 3

    This works similarly to the first approach, but instead of storing values in a list, we use yield to generate each doubled number one at a time when the function is iterated ove


- doubleG(n) is a memory function which means instead of doing all the operation and then printing it, it yields one output at a time as the function is iterated over

#Advantages
    - Efficiency
    - Faster performance
    - Scalability
